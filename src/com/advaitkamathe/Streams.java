  // Stream API is used to process collections of object.
  // A stream is sequence of objects that support various methods which can be applied to produce the desired result

  // Stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels
  // Streams don't change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipeline methods

  // Advantages of using stream
  // 1) Functional Programming
  // 2) Reduced code
  // 3) Bulk Operation

  // Methods:
  // filter() -> for conditional check
  // forEach() -> for iteration
